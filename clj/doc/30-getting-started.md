# Getting started

By default `limabean` will start a REPL for interactive use, for direct evaluation of Clojure expressions, so learning `limabean` is about learning Clojure, and the particular [Clojure functions and data structures](https://tesujimath.github.io/limabean/) it provides for querying a beanfile.

When `limabean` starts, it simply loads the beanfile into `*beans*`.  The top-level functions in the `limabean` Clojure namespace operate solely on `*beans*`.

As a convenience, `*directives*`, `*options*`, and `*registry*` are also created, and all these are exposed as Clojure variables in the REPL.  `*registry*` contains for example the booking method for each account (derived from options and `open` directives).  But to be clear, it is only `*beans*` which is read by the top-level query functions.

There is also a top-level variable `*exception*` which holds the full details of the most recent exception, since stack traces are no longer printed by default.  `(pprint *exception*)` may provide useful information.

These functions build further Clojure data structures, generally maps and vectors, which may be inspected in the REPL directly, or tabulated using `show`.

All these functions accept filters, of which [several are available](https://tesujimath.github.io/limabean/limabean.core.filters.html), with more planned to be added.

There is also a `journal` function, for building a journal of all postings with running balance.

```

Notice that in each case, the raw Clojure data structures are available for arbitrary processing by the user.  (Actually running these examples in the REPL gives nicely colourized output, which is not shown here.)

The intention is that `show` is smart enough to make a decent job of tabulating pretty much anything.  But it is rather early to make too big a claim there! 😅

## Standard queries

A number of standard queries are defined.  Probably many useful ones are currently missing, so please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/tesujimath/limabean/issues).  All support the same mechanism for applying date or account filters, as shown in the examples in the following section.

Of course, the premise of Clojure as user interface means that it is simple to build whatever query is required, as [user provided code](40-plugins.md#User-provided code).

- `balances` - assets and liabilities
- `income-statement` - profit and loss statement, i.e. income and expenses
- `inventory` - raw unfiltered query underlying both `balances` and `income-statement`
- `journal` - show individual postings

Additionally, `rollup` may be applied to any inventory to show totals across sub-accounts for a single currency.

## Further examples

Inventory pre-filtered to assets and liabilities
```
user=> (show (balances))
```

Just expenses and income for the calendar year 2025
```
user=> (show (inventory (f/date>=< 2025 2026) (f/sub-acc "Expenses" "Income")))
```

If you have brought your own `fy` function via [user provided code](40-plugins.md)
```
user=> (show (inventory (fy 25) (f/sub-acc "Expenses" "Income")))
```

This years transactions on current account
```
user=> (show (journal (f/date>= 2026) (f/acc "Assets:Bank:Current")))
```

Rollup for a secondary currency
```
user=> (show (rollup (inventory (f/cur "GBP"))))
```

Payments made to Z Energy or Repco.  (Note that the `-match` filters take a [Clojure regular expression](https://clojure.org/reference/other_functions#regex).)
```
user=> (show (journal (f/sub-acc "Expenses") (f/payee-match #"Z Energy|Repco")))
```

All the payees as a set
```
user=> (set (keep :payee (journal)))
```

### Representation of directives

Directives are represented as Clojure maps, where the `:dct` field identities the type of directive.  The [structure is defined here](../src/limabean/spec.clj) in [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) format.

## Batch usage

While the REPL is envisaged as the primary interface to `limabean`, it is possible to invoke batch queries, for example:

```
kiri> limabean --eval '(show (journal (fy 23)))'
```

Quotes are essential, as what is being passed is Clojure code exactly as it would be typed into the REPL, and that is not at all shell-friendly.

## Environment variables

- `LIMABEAN_BEANFILE` - path to default beanfile unless overridden with `--beanfile`
- `LIMABEAN_USER_CLJ` - colon separated list of Clojure source files to load, containing [user-provided code](40-plugins.md)
- `LIMABEAN_CLJ_LOCAL_ROOT` - path to local Clojure source, when running the [development version](50-development.md)
- `LIMABEAN_CLJ_DEPS` - list of extra Clojure package dependencies, for loading [plugins](40-plugins.md)
- `LIMABEAN_UBERJAR` - path to standalone application jarfile (optionally defined at build time)
- `LIMABEAN_LOG` - path to logfile, for troubleshooting
- `LIMABEAN_POD_LOG` - path to logfile for `limabean-pod` logging including JSON-RPC messages at `DEBUG` level, otherwise no logging
- `LIMABEAN_POD_LOG_LEVEL` - custom log levels for `limabean-pod` as per `RUST_LOG` conventions, or default log levels if omitted
- `LIMABEAN_DEBUG_DIR` - if set, is a directory where intermediate beanfiles (post-plugin, pre-booking), are dumped, for troubleshooting
